<h1>How To control a Segway RMP with Player</h1>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
The original <b>segwayrmp</b> driver was written by
<a href=http://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~sweeney/index.html>John
Sweeney</a>, and overhauled by 
<a href=http://robotics.usc.edu/~gerkey>Brian P. Gerkey</a>, with
help from 
<a href=http://robotics.usc.edu/~ahoward>Andrew Howard</a>.

</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
For some videos of Player controlling a Segway RMP, look
<a href="videos.html">here</a>.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This document describes how to get your Segway RMP (Robotic Mobility
                                                    Platform) under control with the <a href=player.html>Player</a> robot
device server.  Be warned that the driver that allows this control 
(<b>segwayrmp</b>) is brand new, is <i>experimental</i>, and will likely be 
in a state of flux for some time to come.

<h2>The steps</h2>
<ol>

<li><h3><a href=#top name=getcan>Get CAN equipment</a></h3>
<p>
The control interface to the Segway RMP is CAN (Controller Area
                                                Network), an industrial bus standard for which you need a special card.
For redundancy and safety, the RMP uses 2 CAN channels, and you are
required to talk to both of them simultaneously.  Thus, you need a
2-channel CAN card.  The transceivers for these 2 channels must be
opto-isolated.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Player's <b>segwayrmp</b> driver only works with <a
href=http://www.kvaser.com>Kvaser, Inc's</a> CANLIB,
which is a Linux interface library to Kvaser's CAN cards.  CANLIB
should work with any of Kvaser's CAN cards, but we've only tried it
so far with the <a href=http://www.kvaser.com/products/index.htm>LAPcan II</a>, which is a 2-channel
PCMCIA card.  If you do buy the LAPcan II, you'll also need 2 of the
<i>DRVcan DNopto</i> transceiver dongles.  For DARPA MARS participants,
the (discounted) cost for 
the LAPcan II and 2 DNopto dongles together is about US$1000.
</p>
<p>
The underlying CAN I/O subsystem in Player's <b>segwayrmp</b>
driver is modular, to allow for the use of other CAN cards and/or
interface libraries.  If you're interested in adding support
for a non-Kvaser card, take a look in the Player source tree at
<b>server/drivers/mixed/rmp/canio.h</b>, which defines the interface
that you must implement.  Check 
<b>server/drivers/mixed/rmp/canio_kvaser.h</b> and
<b>server/drivers/mixed/rmp/canio_kvaser.cc</b> for an example of how to
implement the interface.  Post questions and comments to the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=42445">developers' list</a>.
</p>

<li><h3><a href=#top name=canlii>Build and install LAPcan drivers and 
CANLIB</a></h3>
<p>
<i>If you're using a non-Kvaser CAN card, then you'll have to do something
different (but functionally equivalent) here.</i>
</p>
<p>
<a
href=http://cgi.algonet.se/htbin/cgiwrap/kvaser/sendfile.cgi?dir=files&file=linuxcan.txt>Download</a> the Linux support package from Kvaser.  Build
and install canlib (as root):<br>
<b># make canlib_install</b><br>
Build and install the LAPcan kernel modules (as root):<br>
<b># make lapcan_install</b><br>
Beware that the install script for the LAPcan modules
(<b>installscript_lapcan.sh</b>) is written in a Redhat-specific
manner, and may require some tweaking to run properly on your
system.  In particular, if you're running Gentoo, try this <a
href=installscript_lapcan.sh>modified script</a> instead.
</p>

<li><h3><a href=#top name=connectcan>Connect CAN equipment</a></h3>
<p>
Insert your CAN card.  If you're not using <b>hotplug</b> (which
                                                             autoloads modules for PCMCIA and USB devices), then you may have to first
load the appropriate module manually.  For the LAPcan II, you need to load
<b>lapcan_cs.o</b>.
</p>
<p>
Connect the transceiver dongles to the card and
to the 2 DB9 ports on the underside of the black control box on the Segway
RMP.
</p>
<p>
You'll need to somehow attach your computer to the Segway.  We've had some
success with putting the laptop in a laptop bag in the footspace of the RMP
and using the bag's shoulder strap to secure it to the robot.  You should
put some thought into this step, because when (not if) the robot falls
over, you don't want your laptop to be destroyed.
</p>


<li><h3><a href=#top name=getplayer>Download CVS snapshot of Player</a></h3>
<p>
There is not yet an official release of Player with the <b>segwayrmp</b>
driver.  For now, get the latest CVS snapshot from our <a
href=../snapshots/snapshots.html>snapshots page</a>.
</p>

<li><h3><a href=#top name=buildplayer>Build Player with Segway RMP 
support</a></h3>
<p>
<i>Note that you need to build and run Player on the computer that is
connected to the Segway's CAN bus (i.e., the laptop that you've physically
                                   attached to the robot)</i>
</p>
<p>
Support for the Segway RMP is disabled by default.  To enable it, run
Player's <b>configure</b> script like so:<br>
<b>$ ./configure --enable-segwayrmp --with-canlib=/usr</b><br>
You might also pass other options (like <b>--prefix</b> or
                                   <b>--with-rtk</b>); see the <a href=../faq.html>FAQ</a> for more info.
To see all available options, do:<br>
<b>$ ./configure --help</b><br>
Now build and install Player:<br>
<b>$ make </b><br>
<b>$ make install</b><br>
</p>

<li><h3><a href=#top name=startsegway>Start Segway RMP</a></h3>
<p>
To start your Segway, hold any one of the keys (they're all the same for the 
                                                RMP) in the ignition slot until it beeps.  We've found the keys somewhat
unreliable, so try all of them, and hold each one in the slot for several
seconds in order to find one that works.
</p>
<p>
The RMP starts out in "tractor mode", wherein it does <i>not</i>
autobalance.  You can control the RMP from software in tractor mode,
but you need to attach some kind of trailer/caster assembly.  To put it
in "balance mode", hold the RMP upright and push the red button on the
handlebars once.  It should beep, turn the handlebar display green with
a happy face and balance itself.
</p>

<li><h3><a href=#top name=startplayer>Start Player</a></h3>
<p>
Start Player with the supplied configuration file.  For example, if you
installed Player in /usr/local (which is the default), then do the 
following:<br>
<b>$ /usr/local/bin/player
/usr/local/share/player/config/segwayrmp.cfg</b><br>
</p>
<p>
The <b>segwayrmp</b> driver supports both the standard 2-D <b>position</b>
interface and the new 3-D <b>position3d</b> interface.   You should use the
<b>position3d</b> interface if you want access to pitch and roll information
from the RMP.
</p>
<p>
There are examples of how to load the driver for each interface in
<b>segwayrmp.cfg</b>.  You should only pick one interface; comment out the
other one.  The <b>position3d</b> interface is brand new and not widely used
or supported.  At the moment, it is only supported in the C++ client library;
use <b>Position3DProxy</b>.  To see the 3-D info, try <b>playerjoy</b> with
the <b>-3d</b> and <b>-v</b> flags.

<li><h3><a href=#top name=play>Play!</a></h3>
<p>
Now it's time to play with your robot.  I highly recommend that you
first try it under manual joystick control.  Included with Player is a
Linux-specific utility called <b>playerjoy</b> (it's installed alongside
                                                  <b>player</b> in <b>bin</b>), which is a Player client that reads
from a joystick and sends appropriate speed commands to a Player server.
It should work with pretty much any basic joystick, although I've only
tested it with analog USB joysticks.
</p>
<p>
Note that because of Player's network-centric design, you can run
<b>playerjoy</b> off-board, for example on a joystick-equipped desktop
machine and point it at Player running on the laptop that's attached
your robot (presumably over a wireless network).  Then you can happily
control the Segway while not being physically near it.  For example,
if the laptop on your RMP is called <b>foo</b>, then run
<b>playerjoy</b> like so:<br>
<b>$ /usr/local/bin/playerjoy -c foo:6665</b><br>
You'll need the <b>-c</b> to cause <b>playerjoy</b> to continuously send
commands (instead of only sending them when the joystick moves).  For safety,
the <b>segwayrmp</b> driver will stop the robot if no new commands have been
received in the last 400ms or so.
</p>
<p>
Your next task is to get the RMP going under autonomous control (after
                                                                 all, this is robotics research).  Look <a href="segwayrmpvideos.html">here</a>
for movies of some of our early successes in autonomous control for
wall-following and obstacle traversal.
